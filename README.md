## Test task:

1. Create a test application using Expo Web
2. The application should: display the text "Hello there" in the middle of the screen and after tapping anywhere on the screen, a background color should be changed to a randomly generated color. You can also add any other feature to the app - that adds bonus points
3. Please do not use any external libraries for color generation
4. Don't use any "AI tools" like ChatGPT or similar.
5. Push code to GitHub
6. Send the link to the GitHub repository back
